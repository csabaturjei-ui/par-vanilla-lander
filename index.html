    <h1>Post Apocalyptic Radio (PAR)</h1>
    <p>Your Decentralized, Social Music Frontier</p>
    <p>Imagine a world where music isn't controlled by a few central platforms, but by the artists and communities who love it. That's the vision behind Post Apocalyptic Radio (P.A.R.) - a new kind of music streaming experience built for the decentralized future.</p>
    <h2>What makes PAR Unique?</h2>

      <div class="feature">
        <h3>Artist-Owned Music</h3>
        <p>Powered by IPFS. Instead of corporate servers, artists directly upload their music to a decentralized network. They own their work, control their content, and earn directly from fans - all without middlemen.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="feature">
        <h3>Solidna Blockchain for Trust & Transparency</h3>
        <p>All music, payment info, and IPFS links are stored on a transparent blockchain. Artists upload a song, a record of it goes onto Solidna, visible to everyone.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="feature">
        <h3>Social Discovery Ring</h3>
        <p>Discover music with a twist. Users recommend tracks to each other in a ring, creating a dynamic, community-driven playlist that evolves with every listen.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="feature">
        <h3>Community-Driven "Most Pinned" Radio</h3>
        <p>Users pin their favorite tracks. The most pinned songs play on the "Most Pinned" radio, automatically compiled - a playlist shaped by the community in real-time.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="feature">
        <h3>Future of Incentives with a Custom Solana Token</h3>
        <p>While not fully implemented in this demo, this includes a future token system where artists and listeners are incentivized to participate.</p>
